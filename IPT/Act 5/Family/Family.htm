				</a>
				
				<p> Lucy is passionate for literature and is in the process of writing her own novel about her adventures with Fairy Tail although she does not like telling anyone about it. Lucy is very kind to her Celestial Spirits and refuses to utilize them as shields or think of them as such. She fights alongside her Spirits and treats them as friends, unlike several other Celestial Spirit Mages, who view them as mere tools and objects.

				<h4> 
					Tetsuya Kuroko
				</h4>
				<a href="tetsuya.htm">
					<button> See Profile </button>
				</a>
				
				<p> Kuroko has a deadpan and straight forward personality. He is very hard working and always tries to satisfy the needs of the team above his own. He has no presence and is quite unnoticeable, a trait that goes well with his misdirection. He has also displayed much respect towards fellow passionate basketball players and thinks that while senpais have to have pride, k≈çhais need to have respect.

				<p> There's nothing really interesting about me. I like manga, anime, reading and some online games? Oh I am quite interested to computers but not in an intense way. I also like to write about my thoughts and stuff but I rarely share it so I think I am my own reader? Anyway, I'm pretty much an ignored open book, and people can literally know what I like when they ask so it doesn't actually matter what I wrote in this.
