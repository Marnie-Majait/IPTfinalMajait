				<p> Google is a really helpful tool for me, not just as a student but also an individual. This is where I go whenever I don't know an answer for a specific question. This is where I would inquire for anything, regardless of how embarrassing it may be. It can also give me the right tools for a specific need. If I need to know the routes of a certain place? I could use google map. If I want to see multiple offers for a hotel reservation? I can simply search for it and a lot of offers would appear.

				<p> Not only because it's my first exposure to social media, it is a really helpful tool to communicate with my classmates, friends and family. It is also really entertaining and a holds a lot of my memories. This is where I get updates from our school, where I find my classmates and their group chats. Where I read some news because of how little I watch television right now. This is where I look for memes and laugh, while sharing it to my own timeline so that my friends would see it too.

				<div class = "tumblr">

				</h2>
				
				<p> Tumblr is my go-to place whenever I want to look at different fandoms I am in. This is where people that also likes my favorite anime, shows or movies are found. Tumblr is a safe place for me, a place where all of my weirdness is accepted as it is. This is where I post my theories and comments about my favorite anime's recent chapter or reblog a scene from a movie that I liked. This is also where I read some drabbles and see some cute fan arts.

				<a href="https:/www.manganato.com" target="_blank"><img src="manganato.png" width="100" height="100">

				</h2>
				
				<p> Manganato is a pirated site, I know it's illegal but I clearly don't have any money or time to look for a legimate website to read manga. I like manganato because it's my main source of reading manga. It's free and I also like reading funny comments about a certain chapter. It's really entertaining to read manga especially that I am not really a big fan of watching anime. The reason for that is because I read much faster than I watch something, so I could finish a series without consuming too much time.

				<div class = "reddit">

				</h2>
				
				<p> Who doesn't like reddit? I mean it's the front page of the internet! They got memes, theories, forums etc. Whatever you need, it's on reddit! I think my favorite thing is reddit is like tumblr where they've got communities where people with the same interest can talk together. One of my favorite subreddits is r/shortscarystories because I really like reading scary stories and because it's short, I can read it fast and read a lot more.
